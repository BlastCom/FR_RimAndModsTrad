As of May 29 2021.
There is a bug in the folders of this mod that you need to drop the translation folder in 2 folders.

First, remove the old french translation in the Language/ folder and drop the new one in it.
Then, copy the Language/ folder and drop the copy in the folder v1.2. 
Without the translation in v1.2 folder, the mod will load the Defs translations inside of v1.1 folder.
(Only the Keyed translations will be loaded correctly)
Go know why...
